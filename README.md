- 👋 Hi, I’m @renners7777
- 👀 I’m interested in changing careers from social work to becoming a software developer/engineer - I know it's a big jump but I'm enjoying the ride so far! 
- 🌱 I am working my way through the freecodecamp curriculum to develop my skills and have joined the forum so that I can find answers to questions I have.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing at the moment because I have just started learning and my skillset is limited.
- 📫 How to reach me:
- twitter @renners7777
