- 👋 Hi, I’m @renners7777
- 👀 I’m interested in changing careers from social work to becoming a software developer/engineer - I know it's a big jump but I'm enjoying the ride so far! 
- 🌱 I am in week 7 of a 30 week software engineering bootcamp #100Devs run by Leon Noel. We have covered html and css in quite a bit of detail and I started Javascript this week. The course cover both front end and back end programming. I still have a lot to learn but my journey is underway!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...opensource projects and freelance work.
